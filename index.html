Project 1 This project aims to predict the sentiment score over a set of reviews. The reviews are mostly about the content of movies or the dvd/blu-rays they purchased. This report aims to explain the attempts we made to build our model for this task.

Project 2 This project aims to predict the link existence between users given their user ids. This report details the approaches and techniques, specifically DeepWalk and Node2Vec, employed to build a model for this link prediction task.

Project 3 This project aims to perform rating prediction for the products given their reviewer ids and product ids. This report details the approaches and techniques, specifically Collaborative Filtering based Recommendation and Wide & Deep Learning, employed to build a model for this rating prediction task.</p>
